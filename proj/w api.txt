Here you receive the documentation for the API.

You will start with synchronizing the products.

I have a manual in Dutch https://5857-rbpapendrecht.easyposonline.nl/apidocs?locale=nl.

The easyPOS Online API is a RESTful API. The messages are communicated JSON messages.

The documentation is interfactief, on the pages of the relevant API calls is usually a possibility to carry out directly to the API

ATTENTION, the test function on the API pages provide direct access to the live database which is logged in!

Use REST API

Endpoint URL format

The specification is as follows:

GET /api/v1/relations/:nr


Starting with the HTTP command, followed by the path. In some URL's are used the double-point, in order to indicate a parameter. For example, in the above Example: No. be replaced by its relationship to request number.

So, for example, to request relationship with number 1 can be used oder standing link:

/api/v1/relations/1

Authorization

To communicate with API, it is necessary to send an authorization token. The way which is preferred is to make use of the HTTP header Authoriztion:

Authorization: Token token="WS23ezf1E1nCqpJhdeS6PDz8q4DnpjJH"


Should it not be possible to send along the above header to the server, then it is also possible to give via the URL (or as a post-variable) the token. The name for the POST or GET variable is auth_token.

/api/v1/relations?auth_token=WS23ezf1E1nCqpJhdeS6PDz8q4DnpjJH


JQuery example POST request

The example below performs an AJAX post request and displays an alert of the response header and body, similar to the way it is implemented in this APIDOCS.

$.ajax({
    url: "https://demo.easyposonline.nl/api/v1/relations",
    headers: { "Authorization": "Token token=\"WS23ezf1E1nCqpJhdeS6PDz8q4DnpjJH\"" },
    type: "POST",
    data: '{ "name": "value", "nr": 12 }',
    contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    dataType: "json",
 
    success: function(data,textStatus,xhr) {
      result = "HTTP " + data['status'] + " " + data['statusText'] + "\n";
      result += data.getAllResponseHeaders() + "\n\n"
 
      if( data.responseJSON ) {
        result += JSON.stringify( data.responseJSON, undefined, 2 ) 
      } else {
        result += data.responseText
      }
      alert( result );
    }
}); 

HTTP Command circumnavigation

Some HTTP communication methods / browsers do not support PUT and DELETE. To circumvent this limitation, it is possible to also give them the command using a parameter called '_method. Here it may be put HTTP command. For example: PUT / Relations / 12 _method = PUT?

Character Encoding

The entire API communication is using. UTF-8 character set.
